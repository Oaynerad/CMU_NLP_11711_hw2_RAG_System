Weddings at the Museums
Make your wedding day truly distinctive at one of the four Carnegie Museums.

Celebrate your big day in the glorious Carnegie Music Hall Foyer, pose for photographs on the awe-inspiring Grand Staircase, and host your cocktail reception along the balcony above.

Or take your wedding to Carnegie Science Center along Pittsburgh’s scenic North Shore, where the new PointView Hall will provide stunning views of the Point and Pittsburgh’s three rivers. Or give your guests something to talk about with a reception at the The Andy Warhol Museum.
