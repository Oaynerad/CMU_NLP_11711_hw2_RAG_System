Music by Laura Kaminsky
Libretto by Crystal Manich • FEBRUARY 28, MARCH 3, 6, 8, 2026

Build the world you want to see.

A group of high school students prepares for a production of Sophocles’ Antigone, joined by a new student, Alona, who comes with a formidable secret.

Pittsburgh Opera is proud to present this gripping world premiere.

Time to Act demonstrates how the arts can uplift and unify victims of trauma, empowering them to act, while giving voice to the young citizens who have been most impacted by an ongoing cycle of devastating school violence.

Time to Act is composed by Laura Kaminsky, whose acclaimed opera As One has become the most-produced modern opera in America.

Emmy Award nominee Crystal Manich, the librettist, is a Pittsburgh Opera mainstay whose works for stage, film, and circus have been seen across the United States, Europe, Argentina, and Australia.


Time to Act is a Co-Commission by Pittsburgh Opera, Opera Montana and Boston Conservatory at Berklee, with additional funding by Opera Santa Barbara.


Michael Sakir conducts; Amy Hutchison directs.
